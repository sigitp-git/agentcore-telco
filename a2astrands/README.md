# A2A Strands: Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework

A comprehensive framework for building sophisticated multi-agent systems using the Strands Agents SDK with Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol support. This collection provides multiple architectural patterns for coordinating AI agents to solve complex tasks through structured collaboration.

## Overview

A2A Strands enables the creation of multi-agent systems where specialized AI agents work together using different coordination patterns. The framework supports both the open A2A protocol for cross-platform agent communication and native Strands multi-agent patterns for internal orchestration.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Support
- **Cross-platform communication** between AI agents
- **Open standard protocol** for agent discovery and collaboration
- **Server and client implementations** for exposing and consuming agents
- **Marketplace integration** for discovering agents from different providers

### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns

#### Agents as Tools Pattern
Transform specialized agents into callable functions for hierarchical delegation:
- **Orchestrator agent** coordinates specialist agents
- **Modular architecture** with focused responsibilities
- **Clear separation of concerns** for maintainable systems

#### Swarm Pattern
Collaborative agent teams with shared context and autonomous coordination:
- **Self-organizing teams** with shared working memory
- **Dynamic task distribution** based on agent capabilities
- **Emergent intelligence** through collective problem-solving
- **Tool-based coordination** between agents

#### Graph Pattern
Deterministic workflows using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs):
- **Structured execution order** based on dependencies
- **Output propagation** along defined edges
- **Conditional logic** for dynamic workflow paths
- **Custom node types** for hybrid AI/deterministic processing

#### Workflow Pattern
Sequential and parallel task coordination with explicit control:
- **Task definition and distribution** with clear assignments
- **Dependency management** for complex multi-step processes
- **Information flow control** between workflow stages
- **State management** with pause/resume capabilities

## Key Features

### Multi-Modal Support
- **Text and image processing** using ContentBlocks
- **Rich input handling** across all orchestration patterns
- **Flexible content types** for diverse use cases

### Advanced Coordination
- **Streaming and synchronous communication** modes
- **Error handling and recovery** mechanisms
- **Performance monitoring** and metrics collection
- **Safety mechanisms** to prevent infinite loops

### Integration Capabilities
- **Native Strands SDK integration** with existing agents
- **Cross-platform A2A compatibility** with other systems
- **Custom tool development** for specialized workflows
- **Nested pattern support** (Graphs containing Swarms, etc.)

## Architecture Patterns

### When to Use Each Pattern

**Agents as Tools**: Best for hierarchical systems where a coordinator delegates to specialists
- Customer service systems with domain experts
- Complex queries requiring multiple types of expertise
- Clear delegation hierarchies

**Swarm**: Ideal for collaborative problem-solving with shared context
- Research and analysis tasks
- Creative projects requiring multiple perspectives
- Problems benefiting from emergent intelligence

**Graph**: Perfect for structured workflows with clear dependencies
- Data processing pipelines
- Multi-stage analysis workflows
- Processes requiring specific execution order

**Workflow**: Optimal for long-running processes with explicit control
- Business process automation
- Complex multi-step procedures
- Tasks requiring monitoring and recovery

**A2A Protocol**: Essential for cross-platform integration
- Agent marketplaces and discovery
- Integration with external AI systems
- Distributed agent architectures

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
# For A2A protocol support
pip install 'strands-agents[a2a]'

# For A2A client tools
pip install 'strands-agents-tools[a2a_client]'
```

### Basic Usage Examples

#### Creating an A2A Server
```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.multiagent.a2a import A2AServer

agent = Agent(name="Calculator", description="Performs calculations")
server = A2AServer(agent=agent)
server.serve()
```

#### Building a Swarm
```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.multiagent import Swarm

agents = [
    Agent(name="researcher", system_prompt="Research specialist..."),
    Agent(name="analyst", system_prompt="Analysis specialist..."),
    Agent(name="writer", system_prompt="Writing specialist...")
]

swarm = Swarm(agents, max_handoffs=20)
result = swarm("Research and analyze market trends")
```

#### Creating a Graph Workflow
```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.multiagent import GraphBuilder

builder = GraphBuilder()
builder.add_node(researcher, "research")
builder.add_node(analyst, "analysis")
builder.add_edge("research", "analysis")

graph = builder.build()
result = graph("Analyze the research data")
```
