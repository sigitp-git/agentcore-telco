# Prometheus Agent MCP Resource Cleanup Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the `prometheus-agentcore/agent.py` file to properly cleanup stdio MCP resources when users exit from the agent, preventing resource leaks and ensuring graceful shutdown.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Memory Initialization Error
- **Problem**: `NameError: name 'memory_name' is not defined` during memory initialization
- **Location**: `create_or_get_memory_resource()` function (line 1368)
- **Root Cause**: Function was trying to use undefined variable `memory_name` instead of the configured constant
- **Solution**: Changed `memory_name` to `AgentConfig.MEMORY_NAME`
- **Result**: Memory initialization now works correctly without undefined variable errors

### 2. Fixed Duplicate Output Issue (Initialization)
- **Problem**: Agent initialization and command line argument processing was happening at module import time, causing duplicate output
- **Root Cause**: Command line argument checking code (lines 409-430) was running at module level instead of being protected by `if __name__ == "__main__"`
- **Solution**: 
  - Moved command line argument processing into `handle_command_line_args()` function
  - Added call to `handle_command_line_args()` at the beginning of `main()` function
  - Moved all initialization code from module level to `initialize_agent()` function
- **Result**: Clean imports with no duplicate output, command line arguments still work when running directly

### 2b. Fixed Runtime Duplicate Output Issue
- **Problem**: Agent responses were being displayed twice during conversation
- **Root Cause**: Strands framework logging was set to INFO level, causing it to output agent responses in addition to the conversation loop's print statement
- **Investigation Method**: Added unique response IDs to track duplication source
  - Responses appeared once with debug ID (from conversation loop) and once without (from strands logging)
- **Solution**: Changed strands logging level from INFO to WARNING: `logging.getLogger("strands").setLevel(logging.WARNING)`
- **Result**: Agent responses now appear only once, eliminating duplicate output

### 3. Enhanced AWSMCPManager Cleanup
- **File**: `prometheus-agentcore/agent.py`
- **Location**: `AWSMCPManager.cleanup()` method
- **Improvements**:
  - Added detailed logging for each cleanup step
  - Enhanced stdio process termination with multiple fallback methods
  - Added graceful termination with `process.terminate()` followed by `process.kill()` if needed
  - Checks multiple possible locations for the underlying process object
  - Prevents double cleanup with `_cleanup_registered` flag
  - Added context manager support (`__enter__` and `__exit__`)

### 4. Global Resource Cleanup Function
- **Function**: `cleanup_all_resources()`
- **Features**:
  - Centralized cleanup for all MCP resources
  - Handles both AWS MCP clients and main gateway MCP client
  - Prevents double cleanup with global `_cleanup_done` flag
  - Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging

### 5. Signal Handling and Exit Management
- **Added**: Signal handlers for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`
- **Added**: `atexit` registration for emergency cleanup
- **Enhanced**: Main function with proper try/finally blocks
- **Enhanced**: ConversationManager exit handling

### 6. Robust Process Termination
- **Process Discovery**: Checks multiple possible locations for stdio processes:
  - `client._client_session._process`
  - `client._session._process` 
  - `client._process`
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Uses `terminate()` first, then `kill()` if needed
- **Timing**: Appropriate delays for graceful termination

### 7. Module Structure Refactoring
- **Moved initialization**: All AWS, MCP, model, and memory initialization moved to `initialize_agent()`
- **Global variables**: Declared at module level but initialized in main function
- **Clean imports**: Module can now be imported without triggering initialization
- **Function updates**: Updated `create_devops_agent()` to accept model_id parameter

### 8. Import Additions
- Added `atexit` and `signal` imports for proper cleanup handling

## Key Features

### Multiple Exit Scenarios Covered
1. **Normal Exit**: User types "exit", "quit", or "bye"
2. **Keyboard Interrupt**: User presses Ctrl+C
3. **Signal Termination**: Process receives SIGTERM
4. **Emergency Exit**: Unexpected program termination

### Cleanup Prevention
- Prevents multiple cleanup attempts that could cause errors
- Uses flags to track cleanup state
- Safe to call cleanup multiple times

### Detailed Logging
- Clear progress messages during cleanup
- Error reporting for failed cleanup attempts
- Success confirmation for completed operations

## Usage

The cleanup happens automatically in all exit scenarios:

```bash
# Normal usage - cleanup happens on exit
python3 prometheus-agentcore/agent.py

# In the agent, type any of these to exit with cleanup:
exit
quit
bye

# Or press Ctrl+C - cleanup will still happen
```

## Testing

The memory initialization fix can be verified by:
```bash
# Test basic import and configuration
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('./prometheus-agentcore')
from agent import AgentConfig
print(f'Memory name: {AgentConfig.MEMORY_NAME}')
"

# Test agent import without errors
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('./prometheus-agentcore')
import agent
print('âœ… Agent imported successfully')
"
```

## Benefits

1. **Resource Management**: Prevents stdio process leaks
2. **Clean Shutdown**: Ensures all MCP connections are properly closed
3. **Error Prevention**: Avoids "broken pipe" and similar errors
4. **User Experience**: Provides clear feedback during shutdown
5. **Reliability**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure cleanup happens

## Technical Details

### Process Termination Flow
1. Try `client.stop(None, None, None)`
2. Fallback to `client.__exit__(None, None, None)`
3. Fallback to `client.close()`
4. Find and terminate underlying stdio process
5. Use `process.terminate()` for graceful shutdown
6. Use `process.kill()` if process doesn't terminate
7. Clear client dictionaries and tool lists

### Error Handling
- Each cleanup step is wrapped in try/catch blocks
- Errors are logged but don't prevent other cleanup steps
- Emergency cleanup ignores all errors to prevent cascading failures

This implementation ensures that the Prometheus agent properly cleans up all MCP resources, particularly stdio-based connections, when users exit the agent through any method.
