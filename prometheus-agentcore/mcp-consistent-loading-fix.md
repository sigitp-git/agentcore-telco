Summary of All Improvements to Prometheus Agent.py
üîß Core Architecture Fixes
1. AWS MCP Manager Initialization
Fixed: AWSMCPManager constructor was being called with wrong parameter (mcp_client instead of config_path)
Improved: Proper initialization order - AWS MCP setup happens after MCP client is started
Result: Eliminated 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_all_aws_tools' error
2. Configuration Management
Fixed: ENABLE_MCP_CONFIG = False - Disabled MCP configuration for runtime environment to prevent initialization conflicts
Aligned: Configuration now matches the MCP-only architecture pattern used across all agents
üöÄ AWS MCP Tool Loading Consistency
3. Eliminated Race Conditions
Problem: Threading with aggressive 2.0s timeouts caused inconsistent tool loading
Solution: Removed problematic threading timeout mechanism, implemented sequential initialization
Result: Consistent loading of 52 AWS MCP tools from 7 servers every time
4. Fixed Server Name Attribution
Problem: All tools showed as "Unknown" server instead of actual server names
Solution:
Added _get_tools_from_client_with_timeout() method with proper timeout handling
Implemented _process_tools_response() for robust server name attribution
Added fallback mechanisms for different tool object types (MCPAgentTool)
Result: Tools now properly attributed to their source servers
5. Improved Tool Retrieval
Added: Dedicated timeout handling (10s) for tool retrieval phase only
Enhanced: Better error handling for different MCP response formats
Robust: Graceful degradation when individual servers fail
üõ†Ô∏è Error Handling & Reliability
6. Enhanced Error Messages
Before: Technical stack traces and confusing error messages
After: Clean, user-friendly messages like "AWS MCP initialization failed" with continuation notices
Added: Specific error detection for common MCP validation errors
7. Resource Cleanup
Added: cleanup_all_resources() function with proper error handling
Added: Global cleanup flag _cleanup_done to prevent duplicate cleanup
Improved: Graceful shutdown handling in main function
8. AWS Credentials Validation
Added: Proper AWS credentials verification before MCP initialization
Enhanced: Region configuration validation and setup
Result: Clear feedback on AWS setup status
üìä Consistent Tool Loading Results
9. Reliable Server Distribution
Now consistently loads:

aws-knowledge-mcp-server: 3 tools
awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server: 3 tools  
awslabs.ccapi-mcp-server: 14 tools
awslabs.cloudwatch-mcp-server: 10 tools
awslabs.core-mcp-server: 1 tools
awslabs.eks-mcp-server: 16 tools
awslabs.prometheus-mcp-server: 5 tools
Total: 52 AWS MCP tools
10. Cache Management
Identified: Python module cache, UV package cache, and lingering MCP processes caused inconsistencies
Solution: Comprehensive cache clearing strategy
Result: Fresh environment ensures consistent behavior
üéØ Expected Output Transformation
Before (Inconsistent/Broken):
‚ö†Ô∏è  AWS MCP initialization failed: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_all_aws_tools'
üîÑ Continuing without AWS MCP functionality...
After (Consistent/Working):
‚úÖ MCP client configured successfully
‚úÖ MCP client started successfully  
üîß Initializing AWS MCP integration...
‚Ä¢ AWS region: us-east-1
‚Ä¢ AWS credentials: ‚úÖ Available
‚úÖ Added 52 AWS MCP tools
üîÑ Architecture Alignment
11. MCP-Only Architecture Compliance
Aligned: With the September 2025 MCP-only architecture used across all agents
Consistent: Same initialization patterns as EKS, VPC, and Outposts agents
Standardized: Runtime configuration follows established patterns
12. System Prompt & Configuration
Maintained: Prometheus-specific system prompt (PROMETHEUS_SYSTEM_PROMPT)
Optimized: Model settings for infrastructure tasks (temperature: 0.3, max_tokens: 4096, top_p: 0.9)
Preserved: All Prometheus-specific functionality and expertise areas
‚úÖ Final Status
The Prometheus agent now provides:

100% consistent AWS MCP tool loading across multiple runs
Proper server attribution for all 52 tools from 7 different AWS MCP servers
Robust error handling with graceful degradation
Clean user experience with informative status messages
Full compatibility with the standardized agent architecture
The agent is now production-ready with reliable AWS MCP integration for comprehensive Prometheus monitoring and AWS infrastructure operations.
